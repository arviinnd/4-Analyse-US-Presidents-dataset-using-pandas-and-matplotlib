Dear everyone <br>
Good morning! <br>
<br>
Subject: Fourth repository <br>
<br>
Respected everyone, this is my fourth repository. This is a dataframe giving information on heights of different presidents of the 
United States of America. The mean, maximum and minimum heights are 180, 193 and 163 centimeters respectively. There are 42 observations 
in each column. The dataframe is sorted according to heights in the notebook. The notebook also has a plot of the heights of the 
presidents at the end. <br>
<br>
Thanks and regards, <br>
Yours sincerely, <br>
Narayanan Arvind
